## **PRODIGY_DS_01: Linear Regression for House Prices**

### **Description**

This repository contains the implementation of a linear regression model to predict house prices based on square footage and the number of bedrooms and bathrooms. The model is built using Python and leverages popular libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn.

### **Contents**

- **Data**: Raw and processed datasets used for training and testing the model.
- **Code**: Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **Notebook**: Jupyter Notebook with detailed steps, visualizations, and analysis.
- **Results**: Metrics and plots demonstrating the performance of the model.

### **Objective**

The goal of this task is to develop a linear regression model that accurately predicts house prices. This involves:
1. **Data Exploration**: Analyzing the dataset to understand the features and target variable.
2. **Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the data for modeling.
3. **Model Building**: Implementing and training a linear regression model.
4. **Evaluation**: Assessing the modelâ€™s performance and making improvements as necessary.
