## **PRODIGY_ML_01: Linear Regression for House Prices**

### **Description**

This repository contains the implementation of a linear regression model to predict house prices based on features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms. The model is built using Python, utilizing popular libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn. All coding was performed on **Kaggle**.

### **Contents**

- **Data**: Processed datasets used for training and testing the model.
- **Code**: Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **Notebook**: Kaggle Notebook with detailed steps, visualizations, and analysis.
- **Results**: Metrics and plots demonstrating the model’s performance.

### **Objective**

The goal of this project is to develop a linear regression model that accurately predicts house prices based on selected features. This involves:
1. **Data Exploration**: Analyzing the dataset to understand key features and the target variable.
2. **Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the data for modeling.
3. **Model Building**: Implementing a linear regression model using scikit-learn.
4. **Evaluation**: Assessing the model’s performance using metrics like MSE, R-squared, and visualizations.


### **Instructions**

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sihemaf/PRODIGY_ML_01.git
2. **Install Dependencies**:
